## General Idea
You are an avid gamer who is extremely excited about the launch the new video game 'Fallout: San Francisco'. This post-apocalyptic role playing game is set in San Fracisco and requires you to wonder the wasteland trying to survive.

You load up the game and are present with a character creation page. At this point, you need to choose which of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes (see below) you want your character to possess. This involves assigning 50 points to the different attributes. The more points you assign to a specific attribube, the more of that ability you're character possesses.

You're friends have already had the game for two weeks and are far into the game. You want to catch up, but don't want to spend time figuring out what the "optimum" player stats are for the game. So, as a resourcful data scientist, you are going to use linear regression to build a model that will test different character builds so that you can find the best one for the game.

As a class we are going to select the "optimum" player stats for the game, and construct a dummy dataset that reflects this choice. Then, the other two presenters with use the linear regression techniques to build a model and find the best set up for the game.
